1. Twitch and Wine
2. When you need to find a wine pairing for the Twitch stream you are watching or about to stream
3. Twitch streamers and watchers (mostly me I guess..)
4. It takes in user input for a couple of questions and the user will then select the game, and a list of wine will populate.
5. Twitch, Wine.com api's
6. jQuery, Materialize, Ajax, eslint
7. That my page looks a bit too plain, and should change my layout to be more welcoming and relate it more to the subject
8. Writing the breadcrumb function. It's pretty ugly but works
