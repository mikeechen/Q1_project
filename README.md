# [Twitch and Wine](http://mikeechen-winetwitch.surge.sh/)

Ever had the problem of trying to decide which wine to have while watching a Twitch stream?
Look no further!! This fun and interactive web app pairs the game you are watching
or streaming with a bottle of wine. But be careful, the more popular the game is,
the more expensive the wine is going to be! Have fun!
